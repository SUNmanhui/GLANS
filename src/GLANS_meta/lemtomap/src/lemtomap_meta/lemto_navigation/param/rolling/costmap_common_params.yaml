# Common costmap params optimized for using move_base with rolling window gmapping (lemto_rw_gmapping) + topological mapping/navigation (lemto_topological_mapping & lemto_navigation)

always_send_full_costmap: true #this way the full costmap is send every cycle to /move_base/{local|global}_costmap/costmap, instead of combining that with a costmap_updates topic. This is required for the line cost calculation to work properly when using rolling window gmapping

  track_unknown_space: true #default: false. Setting to true is needed to use global planner allow_unknown=false option
