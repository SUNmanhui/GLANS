# Move base params optimized for using move_base with rolling window gmapping (lemto_rw_gmapping) + topological mapping/navigation (lemto_topological_mapping & lemto_navigation)

# Move base node parameters. For full documentation of the parameters in this file, please see

shutdown_costmaps: false #default:false

controller_frequency: 5.0 # tbi5.0 (turtlebot indigo)
controller_patience: 3.0 # was 8.0, 15.0 is default. tbi3.0 (turtlebot indigo)

planner_frequency: 1.0 # tbi1.0, 2.0 for turtlebot normally (hydro), 0.0 cannot be used if the map is also explored! newly detected walls/objects will result in the robot trying to drive through it!
  # The rate in Hz at which to run the global planning loop. 
  # If the frequency is set to 0.0, the global planner will only run when a new goal 
  # is received or the local planner reports that its path is blocked. New in navigation 1.6.0
planner_patience: 5.0 #default is 5.0

oscillation_timeout: 10.0
oscillation_distance: 0.2

clearing_rotation_allowed: true #setting this to false blocks the annoying rotating behaviour. But setting it to false can also sometimes make it become stuck against a wall...
